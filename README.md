### Hello there 👋
I am a slow-burning PhD student and statistical consultant / computational modeller. I am broadly interested in modelling uncertainty in natural phenomena and health related processes, and I enjoy my work most when it helps other people.
- 🧠 I’m currently working on finishing my PhD on how the brain deals with uncertainty in the Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences at The University of Melbourne.
- 💊 I worked at the Vic Department of Health from 2021-2023 in the modelling and analytics team in the COVID-19 response. Some of the work I did included simple agent based models, and epideimiological modelling of COVID-19 related vaccine and treatment effectiveness. Before this, I worked at Monash Brain Imaging, and The University of Melbourne.
