### Hello there üëã
I am a slow-burning PhD student and statistical consultant / computational modeller. I am broadly interested in modelling uncertainty in natural phenomena and health related processes, and I enjoy my work most when it helps other people.
- üß† I‚Äôm currently working on finishing my PhD on how the brain deals with uncertainty in the Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences at The University of Melbourne.
- üíä I worked at the Vic Department of Health from 2021-2023 in the modelling and analytics team in the COVID-19 response. Some of the work I did included simple agent based models, and epideimiological modelling of COVID-19 related vaccine and treatment effectiveness. Before this, I worked at Monash Brain Imaging, and The University of Melbourne.

- üëØ **The types of work I do**: Over the past 10 years, I have worked across a range of modelling roles; from research and technical roles in neuroimaging, to consulting, to applied modelling during the COVID-19 pandemic. These experiences have shaped how I think about scientific work; while modelling can certainly be used to analyse existing data, I have found I do my best and most satisfying work when I‚Äôm involved early, helping shape the questions, having debates, clarifying the theory, and designing the studies. In my academic work, I want to focus on deep, theory-driven collaborations, and on getting the experimental design right before doing statistics or cognitive modelling. This helps me refine my research interests, and also makes the science more rigirous, interpretable, impactful, and, most of all - enjoyable. I sometimes make exceptions to this policy (working with friends is fun), but in general I tend not to take on projects where modelling is treated as a post-hoc technical step. People might think this sounds a bit idealistic, especially for someone still early in their career (I'm flattered by your attributions of youthfulness, really), but I‚Äôm a pretty values-driven person and protecting my agency helps me do better work, so I trust that is okay.

### Recent work
- In the first half of 2025 I worked with [Dr Christina Howley](https://au.linkedin.com/in/christina-m-howley-68653b25) and Samantha Hobbs from Cape York Water Partnerships as a statistical consultant to help analyse whether pre-emptive burning in the Cape York Region has helped reduce fires in the late dry season. We ran some basic stats, some more advanced models, and I produced some reports, which contributed to a really
